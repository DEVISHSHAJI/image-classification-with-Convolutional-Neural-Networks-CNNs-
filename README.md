# image-classification-with-Convolutional-Neural-Networks-CNNs-
# Image Classification Project

This project is a simple end-to-end example of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It uses the CIFAR-10 dataset and a basic CNN model to classify images into different classes.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or any other deep learning library
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image_classification_project.git
   cd image_classification_project
**Project Structure**

cifar-10-batches-py/: Directory containing the CIFAR-10 dataset.
 model_training.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook for training the CNN model.
 image_classification_model.h5: Pre-trained CNN model.
 predict_image.py: Script to predict the class of a single image.
 requirements.txt: List of Python dependencies.


**Training the Model**
 To train the model, run the model_training.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook.

****Predicting with the Pre-trained Model**
 Use the predict_image.py script to predict the class of a single image. Example usage:
